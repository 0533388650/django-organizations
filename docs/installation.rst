Installation
============

First add the application to your Python path. The easiest way is to use
`pip`::

    pip install django-organizations

You should install by downloading the source and running::

    $ python setup.py install

Configuration
-------------

Make sure you have `django.contrib.auth` installed, and add the `organizations`
application to your `INSTALLED_APPS` list::

    INSTALLED_APPS = (
        ...
        'django.contrib.auth',
        'organizations',
    )

Then ensure that your project URL conf is updated. You should hook in the
main application URL conf as well as your chosen invitation backend URLs::

    from organizations.backends import invitation_backend

    urlpatterns = patterns('',
        ...
        url(r'^accounts/', include('organizations.urls')),
        url(r'^invitations/', include(invitation_backend().get_urls())),
    )

You can specify a different invitation backend in your project settings, and
the `invitation_backend` function will provide the URLs defined by that
backend::

    ORGS_INVITATION_BACKEND = 'myapp.backends.MyInvitationBackend'
